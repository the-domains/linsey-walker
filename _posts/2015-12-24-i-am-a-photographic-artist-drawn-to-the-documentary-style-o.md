Artist Statement

# Landscapes, architecture, and lost and lonely
objects often inspire me. I seek to capture the essence, or soul, of my
subjects, and try to steer clear of romantic clich√©s and show local
flavour without compromising my subjects to cultural stereotypes.

# 

My process is intuitive in nature, and my work
is a reflection of self, in response to place.
