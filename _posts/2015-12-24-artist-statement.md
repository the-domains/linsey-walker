# Artist Statement
![Self Portrait](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7fa142d3-20a4-4f5c-847e-c5dd260ba1a3.jpg)

I am a photographic artist, drawn to the
documentary style of photography. Meaning that I don't pre-visualize my images,
but rather find them through the process of wandering. 

Landscapes, architecture, and lost and lonely
objects often inspire me. I seek to capture the essence, or soul, of my
subjects, and try to steer clear of romantic clich√©s and show local
flavour without compromising my subjects to cultural stereotypes. 

My process is intuitive in nature, and my work
is a reflection of self, in response to place.
